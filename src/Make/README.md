## What is a Makefile?
A Makefile defines a graph of so-called `rules`. Each rule creates a target, and it can have pre-requisites.

##What is the purpose of Makefiles?
The main purpose of a Makefile (as opposed to always creating targets) is to the minimum amount of work needed
to `update` those targets to the most version of the source.
