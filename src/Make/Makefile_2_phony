# To execute:
# make -f Makefile_2_phony  <target> 


# A "phony" target is a target that is not a file.
# Therefore, make will _always_ execute it (since it can never be up to date)
# Common phony targets are: all make clean install ...
all: maker file0.txt
	@echo "executing target all"

# note that we can declare things out of order
maker:
	@echo "executing target maker" 
	touch file1.txt

file0.txt:
	@echo "executing target file0.txt" 
	touch file0.txt
	
clean:
	@echo "executing target clean"
	@rm -f file0.txt file1.txt

# Just in case there are actual files with the same name as our phoney targets,
# we list our phoney targets here 
.PHONEY: all maker clean
