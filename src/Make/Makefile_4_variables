# the content of this tutorial is largely taken from "https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/make/".

# There are 4 places to set variable:
# 1- Commandline arguments:      make target  name=erfan 
# 2- Inside the makefile, as is done in here.
# 3- Shell environment vars: All variables you can see here: printenv
# 4- Make built-in vars (see below)

# variables are all string types
family="Zamanian"
family2=Zamanian # same thing
fullname = $(name)
fullname += $(family)  # appending (it also includes a space)

# lazy assignment vs immediate assignment
id = 24
var_lazy  = $(family)_$(id)	   # evaluated recursively everytime it is used (so can change).
var_imm   :=  $(family)_$(id)  # evaluated immediately, so will not change later
id = 99
$(info new value for $$id is ${id})	# This is how you print sth outside of targets


all: echo_vars echo_builtin

echo_vars:
	@echo "printing commandline and user-defined vars:"
	@echo '$$name is:      ' $(name)
	@echo 'equivalent:    ' ${name} # this is exactly the same as $() 
	@echo 'Full name:     ' $(fullname)
	@echo 'var_lazy:      ' $(var_lazy)
	@echo 'var_imm:       ' $(var_imm)
	#@echo $name # won't work, treated as $n
	@echo 'undefined var: '$(alaki) # unknown vars are treated as empty string	
	@echo "\n"
	
# make has some built-in  variables
echo_builtin:
	@echo "built-in vars:"
	@echo "CC:  " $(CC)
	@echo "CXX: " ${CXX}
	@echo "CFLAGS: " ${CFLAGS}
	@echo "CPPFLAGS: " $(CPPFLAGS)
	@echo "CXXFLAGS: " ${CXXFLAGS}
	@echo "LDFLAGS:  " $(LDFLAGS)
	@echo "LDLIBS:   " ${LDLIBS}
